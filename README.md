A simpler way of keeping tabs with your friends

Submission for Shellhacks 2023 - all built within 24 hours

### Check out yuome [here!](http://yuome.vercel.app)

yuome is a way of helping you and your friends keep track of how much you all owe each other. Because we understand that most people do not want to sign up for a new service or install a new app, yuome was specifically built to be simple to use.

## Deploy locally

Deploying is easy. Clone the repo into it's own folder, and run the following command to install all packages required:
```
npm i
```
Once that has finished, you can start up the development server using:
```
npm run dev
```

You can then visit the app at http://localhost:3000
